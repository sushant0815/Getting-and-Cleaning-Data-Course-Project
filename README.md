1. Copy script Run_anaylis.R to folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
2. It should have test, train folders and the required text files mentioned in the script.
3. The script will load all the files data using read.table() to corresponding varibales.
4. Solution to each question is mentioned under subsection Part#{1-5} in the script.

Assumptions (due to ambiguity)
1. Part#2: I have only taken account of mean() and std() features which will correspond to 66 features and hence 68 variables in both the data frames.
2. Both the train and test data have been merged into a single data frame.
